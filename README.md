Background: I had just made myself breakfast, when I grabbed the tv remote and put on the YouTube app on my LG TV. YouTube is fantastic for watching and learning all sorts of information. In todays society everything we need is on YouTube. After selecting my video, I expected the video to begin after an ad. Ads usually last between ten and fifteen seconds, which is annoying but fair enough. In recent times (december 2023) YouTube has now decided to force 30 seconds of ads when using the free version of YouTube on LG TVs. After traveling home i discovered the ads lasts 40 and even 50 seconds, without the options to skip any time. This is robbing people of their time while providing nothing in return. This is totally unacceptable.
