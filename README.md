I had just made myself breakfast, when I grabbed the tv remote and put on the YouTube app on my LG TV. YouTube is fantastic for watching and learning all sorts of information. In todays society everything we need is on YouTube. After selecting my video, I expected the video to begin after an ad. Ads usually last between five and ten seconds, which is annoying but fair enough. In recent times (december 2023) YouTube has now decided to force 30 seconds of ads when using the free version of YouTube on LG TVs. This is robbing people of their time while providing nothing in return. This is unacceptable. 


## Are you tired of being tracked, bombarded with ads and being robbed of your valuable time?
